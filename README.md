# Contact App backend

This is a Node.js app I built to demonstrate my skills and experience with Node.js, Express, and other related technologies.

## About the App

This app allows users to: 

- Create an account and log in 
- View list of contact
- Add new contact
- Edit and delete existing contact

The app showcases RESTful APIs, routing, authentication, and MongoDB integration.

## Getting Started

To run this Node.js project on your local machine:

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal. 

4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

5. Set up a MongoDB database and add connection string to `.env` file.
   
6. add jwt_secret to the .env file also

7. Run `npm run dev` to start the app in development mode.

The app should now be running on `http://localhost:5001` is the port variable is not set in the .env file.
